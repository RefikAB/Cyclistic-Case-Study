# Cyclistic-Case-Study

Introduction

The project forms an integral part of the capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certification course, focusing on analyzing the trip data of Cyclistic, a bike share company.

Cyclistic offers two service models: "casual" riders who purchase individual passes and "member" riders who subscribe annually. The company operates in Chicago and boasts a fleet of approximately 6000 bicycles across 700 stations.

The primary objective for future growth and long-term success lies in maximizing the number of annual members, which ensures financial stability and promotes customer retention. By uncovering valuable insights, effective marketing strategies can be developed to successfully convert casual riders into loyal annual members.
